# Docker Complete

This Repo consists of my docker practicing setups and different Learning modules:
- Images, Containers
- Volumes & Bind Mounts
- Networking (cross container communication)
- Building mutli-container applications with docker

  Will be adding more of my notes and my learnings of Docker and Kubernetes to this repo.

## Docker Containers and Data

Containers are isolated and stateless
- **isolated**
  Containers have their own data and filesystem, detached from the host machine filesystem
- **Statless**
  They can store data
internally, but data will
be lost if the container is
removed and replaced
by a new one
