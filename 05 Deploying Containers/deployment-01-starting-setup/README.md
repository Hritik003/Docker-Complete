# Directory contains?

This Directory contains a simple `nodeJS` application with a docker file. So lets try to `build` and `run` this,

```
docker build -t node-dep-example .
```
```
docker run -d --rm --name node-dep -p 5000:5000  node-dep-example
```
and this is what it looks at `localhost:5000`,

## AWS EC2 Instance

Once you sucessfully create a new `free-tier` account, you can create a new instance in the management dashboard with the default settings.

> **_Note:_** Do not forget to download the `<name>.pem` file which is the key to access the cloud instance from the remote machine.

- It may take a while for the cloud instance state to change from `pending` to `running`

And then go to the project root folder( make sure to put the .pem file into the project root folder) to connect to the instance via `ssh` key.

- To connect, click on the connect in the running-instances page and something like pops out which are the instructions to set up using ssh key.

And now you should be able to see the ipaddress of the instance in your terminal, and follow the following steps:

```
sudo yum update -y
```
```
sudo yum -y install docker
```
```
sudo service docker start
```
```
sudo usermod -a -G docker ec2-user
```

Thereafter, you can check whether Docker is available by running:

```
docker version
```
